If this feelin' flows both ways?\n(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay\n(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made\nFor sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day\n\nCrawlin' back to you\nEver thought of callin' when\nYou've had a few?\n'Cause I always do\nMaybe I'm too\nBusy bein' yours\nTo fall for somebody new\nNow, I've thought it through\nCrawlin' back to you\n\nSo have you got the guts?\nBeen wonderin' if your heart's still open\nAnd if so, I wanna know what time it shuts\nSimmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt\nIt's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you\nI don't know if you feel the same as I do\nBut we could be together if you wanted to\n\n(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?\n(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay\n(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made\nFor sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day\n\nCrawlin' back to you (crawlin' back to you)\nEver thought of callin' when\nYou've had a few? (had a few)\n'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)\nMaybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy)\nBusy bein' yours (bein' yours)\nTo fall for somebody new\nNow, I've thought it through\nCrawlin' back to you\n\n(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?\n(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay\n(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made\nFor sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day\n(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall\n(Sad to see you go) Ever thought of callin', darlin'?\n(Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to you?",

It's harder and harder to get you to listen More I get through the gears Incapable of makin' alright decisions, and havin' bad ideas Now it's three in the mornin' and I'm tryin' to change your mind Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply Why'd you only call me when you're high? Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high? And I can't see you here, wonderin' where am I It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time I haven't found all I was hopin' to find You said you gotta be up in the mornin' Gonna have an early night And you're startin' to bore me, baby Why'd you only call me when you're high? Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high? Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high? Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high? Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?",

I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck Or I did last time I checked Not shy of a spark The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start I'm going back to 505 If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side With your hands between your thighs But I crumble completely when you cry It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise Take my hands off of your eyes too soon I'm going back to 505 If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side With your hands between your thighs and a smile",

Do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath That says that we are defenders Of any poseur or professional pretender around When did your list replace the twist and turn Like a fist replaced the kiss? Don't concern us with your bollocks, I don't want your prayer Save it for the morning after And it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder Don't be surprised when you get bent over They told ya, but you were dying for it Let's have a game on the teddy picker Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?

I'm tryin' to talk!\nHey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk\nBut I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you\n'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too\nWell, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now\nOh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?\nMy tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'll all be gray\nPut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me, that it's not so bad\nIt's not so bad\nDear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy\nYou said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?\nLook, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that\nAnd here's an autograph for your brother\nI wrote it on the Starter cap\nI'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you\nDon't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you\nBut what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?\nI say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?\nYou got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling\nTo help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some\nAnd what's this shit about us meant to be together?\nThat type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other\nI really think you and your girlfriend need each other\nOr maybe you just need to treat her better\nI hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time\nBefore you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine\nIf you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan\nWhy are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan\nI just don't want you to do some crazy shit\nI seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick\nSome dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge\nAnd had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid\nAnd in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to\nCome to think about, his name was, it was you\nDamn!",

divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Ahh)\nIt's the return of the, oh wait, no way, you're kidding\nHe didn't just say what I think he did, did he\nAnd Dr. Dre said, nothing you idiots\nDr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Haha)\nFeminist women love Eminem\nChicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady, I'm sick of him\nLook at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what\nFlippin' the you-know-who, yeah but he's so cute though\nYeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose\nBut no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents bedrooms\nSometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't\nBut it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose\nMy bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips\nAnd if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss\nAnd that's the

Discovery Channel don't they\nWe ain't nothin' but mammals\nWell, some of us are cannibals\nWho cut other people open like cantaloupes\nBut if we can hump dead animals and antelopes\nThen there's no

think I give a damn about a Grammy\nHalf of you critics can't even stomach me\nLet alone stand me\nBut Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird\nWhy, so you guys can just lie to get me here\nSo you can sit me here next to Britney Spears\nShit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs\nSo I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst\nAnd hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first\nLittle bitch put me on blast on MTV\nYeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe\nI should download her audio on mp3\nAnd show the whole world, how you gave Eminem VD (Ahh)\nI'm sick of you little
